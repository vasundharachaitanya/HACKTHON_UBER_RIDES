# Uber Rides Data Analysis and Machine Learning Modeling
# Introduction
Welcome to the Uber Rides Data Analysis and Machine Learning Modeling project! This repository contains the code, data, and documentation for analyzing Uber rides data recorded between 2009-01-01 and 2015-06-30. As a Data Analyst Intern at Uber, this project aims to provide valuable insights into the rides data and build predictive models to improve Uber's services.
# Project Overview
In this project, we explore the Uber rides dataset from 2009 to mid-2015. Our primary objectives include:

Data Cleaning and Preprocessing: We start by cleaning and preprocessing the raw data to make it suitable for analysis and modeling.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): We perform EDA to gain a deeper understanding of the dataset, identify patterns, and uncover insights about Uber's ride history during this period.

Machine Learning Modeling: We build machine learning models to predict various aspects related to Uber rides, such as demand forecasting, surge pricing, and ride duration.

Evaluation and Optimization: We evaluate the performance of our models and optimize them to improve accuracy and efficiency.
